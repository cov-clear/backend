## Getting started

Start with

`npm install`

Then run

`docker-compose up`

to get the development postgres instance up, then run

`npm run develop`

to get a reloading server environment up.

## Tasks:

- `npm run build`: builds typescript for deployment
- `npm run start`: starts (an already built) application
- `npm run develop`: runs your code in an automatically-reloading environment
- `npm run test`: runs all tests
- `npm run test:watch`: starts a live reloading test environment (use this for development)
- `npm run format`: formats your code with prettier (will do this automatically on commit)
